# MapPractice

* Create a class `Map Practice` and make some tests pass. :)

* `findValueOf` given a `Map` and an `Object` representing a key 
* in the map, will retrieve the value assigned to that key.

* `findKeysOf` given a `Map` and an `Object` representing a value in the map, 
* will return an `Object[]` of all keys assigned to that value.

* `fibonacciTree` should return a `Map` of the first `size` numbers 
* in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html). 
* The keys should represent the position in the sequence that the value is in in the sequence. 
* Please refer to tests/Google for clarification.

* `crazySpiral` should return a `Map` of the first `size` numbers in a sequence starting 
* with `first` and `second`. The third number should be the sum of the first two, the fourth
* the sum of 2 and 3, etc. The keys should represent the position in the sequence that the value
* is in in the sequence. Please refer to tests/Google for clarification.
