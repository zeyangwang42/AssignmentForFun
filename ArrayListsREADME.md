# ArrayLists

* Create a class `ArrayLists` and make some tests pass. :)

* `addShit` should append the contents of `list2` to the end of `list1`.

* `addShitTogether` should sum up all of the values in `list1` and `list2` and return that value.

* `removeAll` should remove all instances of `toRemove` from `original` and return an `ArrayList`.

* `happyList` determines if a `ArrayList<String>` that gets passed in is happy or not. A list is happy 
* if and only if all of it's elements are happy. An element is happy if it shares a character with the string
* behind it and if it shares a character with the string in front of it. (Both conditions if applicable)
* The characters that it shares with its neighbors do not have to be the same character as the elements can 
* be happy with everyone doing their own thing.
