# ArrayLists

* Create a class `ArrayLists` and make some tests pass. :)

* `addShit` should append the contents of `list2` to the end of `list1`.

* `addShitTogether` should sum up all of the values in `list1` and `list2` and return that value.

* `removeAll` should remove all instances of `toRemove` from `original` and return an `ArrayList`.

* `happyList` determines if a `ArrayList<String>` that gets passed in is happy or not. A list is happy if and only if all of it's elements are happy. An element is happy if it shares a character with the string behind it and if it shares a character with the string in front of it. (Both conditions if applicable) The characters that it shares with its neighbors do not have to be the same character as the elements can be happy with everyone doing their own thing.
